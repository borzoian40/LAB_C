/*
Exercise 6. Starting from the code of Exercise 5, write a C program that reads a set of operations from 
a text file, reported one per line. The program should create a second file, reporting in each 
line the operator and the result of the corresponding operation in the input file. The result 
should be written with two digits after the decimal point, as in the example below. 
Example
Input file: Operations.txt:
+ 15.225 30.51
- 42.1 10.01
* 0.62 2.4
/ 5.0 2.5
Output file: Results.txt:
+ 45.74
- 32.09
* 1.49
/ 2.00
